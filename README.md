# StockWise

This is a data science project that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict stock trends. The project includes a web application built with Streamlit, Python scripts for data processing and model training using Keras, and visualization of results using Matplotlib.

## Features

- Real-time stock trend prediction
- Interactive web application
- User-friendly interface
- Historical data analysis
- Visualization of predicted trends

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/branified/StockWise.git
   cd StockWise
   ```
2. Make sure dependencies are installed

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Choose Ticker that you want to analyze
3. Hit enter and get historical data and predictions

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main script that runs the Streamlit application and visualizations.
- `LSTM_Model.ipynb`: Python script for model training and prediction using Keras.
- `keras_model.h5`: Trained model that is used for predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: Python library for building interactive web applications.
- Python: Programming language used for the project.
- Keras: Deep learning framework used for training the stock trend prediction model.
- Matplotlib: Python library for creating visualizations.
